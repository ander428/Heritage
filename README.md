# Heritage
You are a small medieval town that is trying to survive in a harsh world. You have famers, scientists, artists, and knights. You must make decisions to best grow your society trading off hunger, technological advancement, happiness, and military power. You must keep your people fed or your town will not be able to grow! Through research you may find ways to more efficiently produce food or stronger weapons for fighting! If your people are not happy enough, they will leave the town! With a strong military, you can keep your farms well guarded! Seems easy, right? Well there are other towns as well trying to accomplish the same goal. The difference is they are smart and pass down a stronger generation as the game progresses. If you aren't too careful, they might conquer you!
